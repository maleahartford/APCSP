  <h1>Hi, I'm Malea Hartford. My name comes from the Hawaiian word that means peace. I love to play soccer, hike near the ocean, swim, and of course spend time with my family and friends. I'm really intrested in school and my favorite subjects are anything math and science related. English is not my strong suit. I am also recently intrested in interior design, and my friends would say that everytime they come over soemthing has changed in my room.</h1>
